This is based on the lessons from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/typescript/topusers) / [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/) and general engagement with the [TypeScript community](https://github.com/TypeStrong/). You can [follow for updates](https://twitter.com/basarat) and [don't forget to â˜… on Github](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book) ðŸŒ¹
